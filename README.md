# Frontend Developer Exercises

This repository contains two exercises that you need to complete as part of the frontend developer position application at Ancoria Bank. These exercises are designed to evaluate your skills and understanding of frontend web development concepts. Each exercise is accompanied by specific instructions to guide you through the task.

## Exercise 1: Lamps

Eight lamps, represented as cells, are arranged in a straight line.
Each day every cell competes with its adjacent cells. An integer value 1 represents an active cell and a
value of 0 represent an inactive cell.
If the neighbor on both the sides of the cell are both active or inactive, the cell becomes inactive in the
next day, otherwise they become active.
The two cells on each end have a single adjacent cell, so assume that the unoccupied space in the
opposite side is an inactive cell. Even after updating the cell state, consider its previous state when
updating the state of others cells. The state information of the cells should be updated simultaneously.

## Exercise 2: GCD of N numbers

The greatest common divisor (GCD), also called the highest common factor (HCF) of N numbers is the
largest positive integer that divides all numbers without giving a remainder.
Write an algorithm to determine the GCD of N positive integers.

## Solutions

The solution for `Exercise 1` can be found in the `lamps.js` file where the solution for `Exercise 2` can be found in the `gcds.js` file.

In the repository I put together an `index.html` file containing a quick and dirty UI in order to test both exercises simultaneously.
